GNOSYS Personal Builder License (GPBL) v1.0

Copyright © 2025 Isaac Wostrel-Rubin
Guardian of the GNOSYS / Sanctuary Stack

GNOSYS and the Sanctuary libraries are free, open, and hackable for personal and internal use.
Run them, fork them, and share them — with one core constraint:

You can't sell them or run them as-a-service without a separate commercial license from me.

⸻

1  You Can

You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to:
    •    Run GNOSYS / Sanctuary libraries anywhere, for yourself or inside your own org, for free.
    •    Study, modify, and extend the code, including:
    •    Changing behavior, structure, or architecture
    •    Adding MCPs, agents, workflows, UI, or integrations
    •    Share your modified versions (forks, patches, examples) publicly, as long as:
    •    You keep this license text, and
    •    Your distribution stays non-commercial (see §3).

This applies to:
    •    The GNOSYS meta-library
    •    Sanctuary / STARSYSTEM / HEAVEN / CartON / related libraries and tools in this repo
    •    Any example configs or reference agents shipped with them

unless a specific file or subproject explicitly states a different license.

⸻

2  Please Do

To keep the ecosystem coherent:
    •    Keep this license notice and a link back to the main repo.
    •    Clearly mark modifications (e.g. in the README:
"This is a modified version of GNOSYS by <your name>."
    •    When possible, credit GNOSYS / Sanctuary in docs or marketing as the underlying stack.

⸻

3  You Can't (Without a Commercial License)

You may not, without a separate written commercial license from Isaac Wostrel-Rubin:
    •    Sell GNOSYS / Sanctuary itself, including:
    •    Paid downloads, paywalled builds, or subscriptions
    •    "Pro" binaries where GNOSYS is the primary value
    •    Offer GNOSYS / Sanctuary as a hosted or managed service, including:
    •    SaaS platforms, hosted agents, or API products where:
    •    GNOSYS / Sanctuary code is a core dependency and
    •    Third parties sign up, pay, or are billed for access
    •    Bundle GNOSYS / Sanctuary into another paid product, where:
    •    The libraries are a key part of the product's value, even if not visible
    •    Or the product would not realistically function as-sold without them
    •    Re-license this code under a different, more permissive or commercial license.

If you want to:
    •    Build a SaaS,
    •    Embed this stack in a product, or
    •    Sell access to agents powered by GNOSYS / Sanctuary,
then you need a commercial license. See §9.

4  What Is Allowed Commercially

You may, without a separate license:
    •    Charge for your time and expertise, including:
    •    Consulting, coaching, architecture, and design work
    •    Installation, customization, and integration of GNOSYS / Sanctuary on the client's own infrastructure
    •    Teaching others how to use, extend, or modify the stack
    •    Use GNOSYS internally to:
    •    Accelerate your own work
    •    Build internal tools and workflows not sold as products
    •    Support your own content, research, or services

Put simply:

Selling your brain is OK. Selling GNOSYS / Sanctuary as a product or hosted service is not, unless you've got a commercial agreement.

⸻

5  Trademarks & Naming

"GNOSYS", "Sanctuary System", "STARSYSTEM", "Victory-Everything Chain (VEC)", "OMNISANC", and related marks, names, or logos may be protected as trademarks or service marks.

Under this license you:
    •    May reference these names factually (e.g. "Built on GNOSYS"), and
    •    May not imply official endorsement, partnership, or authorship by Isaac Wostrel-Rubin unless you actually have that agreement.

If you fork the stack into your own product, use your own brand and clearly mark it as such.

⸻

6  No Warranty

The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to:
    •    Merchantability
    •    Fitness for a particular purpose
    •    Non-infringement

You assume all risk for using, modifying, or deploying this code.

⸻

7  Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the author(s) or copyright holder(s) be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

⸻

8  Termination

If you violate this license and do not remedy the violation within 30 days of being notified:
    •    Your rights under this license automatically terminate.
    •    You must stop using, distributing, or hosting GNOSYS / Sanctuary under this license.

The author may grant you a new license at their sole discretion after remediation.

⸻

9  Commercial Licensing

If you want to:
    •    Run GNOSYS / Sanctuary as a SaaS or hosted agent platform
    •    Embed it into a commercial product
    •    Resell it or bundle it into paid offerings

you must obtain a commercial license.

To do that:
    1.    Book a paid licensing meeting via
👉 https://isaacwr.carrd.co
and note that you are requesting a GNOSYS / Sanctuary commercial license.
    2.    The meeting payment reserves Isaac's time and is non-refundable if you decide not to purchase the license.
    3.    If you proceed, the meeting fee will be discounted against the license price.

The standard commercial license is:

$997 USD — universal commercial rights
(to use GNOSYS / Sanctuary in your own commercial products and services, subject to the terms in the commercial agreement).

Do not book this meeting unless you are seriously intending to obtain the license; the call fee compensates for time even if you choose not to move forward.
